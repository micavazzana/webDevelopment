<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- It should always start with this, because it tells the browser wich version of html uses (html5) 
HTML5 introduces more descriptive HTML tags. 
These include main, header, footer, nav, video, article, section and others.
These tags give a descriptive structure to your HTML, make your HTML easier to read, 
and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility. 
The main HTML5 tag helps search engines and other developers find the main content of your page. -->
<html>
<!-- all the code must be inside the tag html-->

<head>
    <!-- the head is used for titles, or meta information, external css or javascript, things not visible for the user -->
    <title>TITLE
        <!-- for making the title on the tag of the browser -->
    </title>
</head>

<body>
    <!-- here goes everything that's visible in the browser -->
    <h1>LOREM IPSUM TITLE</h1>
    <!-- the h1 is a header, there are 6 types. Is VERY important for the SEO -->
    <h2>Paragraphs</h2>
    <p>
        <!-- Every paragraph goes betwwen this tags. Each paragraph should go on separate tags-->
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor

    </p>

    <p>
        <!-- This is another paragraph -->
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, <br />
        <!-- the br adds a break. It doesn't have open and close tags -->
        <b>
                <!-- the b turns the text in bold -->
                sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna
                aliqua. Ut
                enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris

                Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa
                qui
                officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum
            </b>
        <!-- Another way of doing this is using the <strong> tag -->
        <!-- For making italic text the tag is: <i></i>   or  <em></em>  (the em is preferable for accessibility) -->
    </p>

    <h2>Unordered Lists</h2>
    <ul>
        <!-- the ul tag is for making unordered lists. This are followed by any number of elements usin the <li> tag -->
        <li>An item</li>
        <li>Another item</li>
        <li>And one more item</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ordered Lists</h2>
    <!-- Ordered Lists are the same, they just add an enumerating order-->
    <ol>
        <li>An item</li>
        <li>Another item</li>
        <li>And one more item</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Images</h2>
    <!-- You can add images to your website by using the img tag,
        and point to a specific image's URL using the src attribute.
        The img tag doesn't have a closing tag -->
    <img src="https://image.shutterstock.com/image-photo/british-shorthair-kitten-silver-color-600w-1510641710.jpg" />
    <!-- The img can be located in a url address (absolute linking) or near the .html document (relative linking).
    All img must have an alt attribute. 
    The text inside an alt attribute is used for screen readers to improve accessibility 
    and is displayed if the image fails to load.
    Note: If the image is purely decorative, using an empty alt attribute is a best practice.
    Ideally the alt attribute should not contain special characters unless needed.
    An img can have different attributes like the width -->
    <br />
    <img src="images/kitty.jpg" alt="Beautifiul Kitty playing" width="250" />

    <h2>Hyperlinking</h2>
    <!--   It uses an <a> (anchor) tag and then an href attribute to linking to another site.          
            Can also be used to create internal links to jump to different sections within a webpage.
            To create an internal link, you assign a link's href attribute to a hash symbol # 
            plus the value of the id attribute for the element that you want to internally link to, 
            usually further down the page. You then need to add the same id attribute to the 
            element you are linking to. An id is an attribute that uniquely describes an element.-->
    <a href="contact.html">Click here for contact</a>
    <!-- This will lead to another html in my directory of web pages I'm writing, maybe a contact page -->
    <br />

    <a href="#bio">About me</a>
    <!-- This will lead to the header that has the id bio below-->
    <h3 id="bio">About me</h3>

    <a href="https://google.com" target="blank">Search in google</a>
    <!-- In this examples the linking replaced the page in wich I was, but if I want to link to a new page I have to add the target attribute and set it to "blank"-->
    <br />

    <p>
        <!-- anchor nested to a pragraph -->
        Here's a link to
        <a href="https://google.com" target="blank"> google</a> for you to do a search.
    </p>

    <a href="mailto:micaela.vazzana@gmail.com" target="blank">Write me</a>
    <!--This will open the mailing app and adress it to that mail. The mailto attribute does this-->
    <br />

    <a href="images/kitty.jpg" target="blank">Download this file</a>
    <!--This will link to a file in my website for downloading it (for example) -->
    <br />

    <!-- Dead Links:
    Sometimes you want to add a elements to your website before you know where they will link.
    Replace the href attribute value with a # -->
    <a href="#" target="blank">Cat photos</a>
    <br />

    <h2>Audios and Videos</h2>
    <!-- HTML5 has the possibility of inserting audio and videos through their own tags-->
    <audio controls>
            <source src="audio & videos/12 - Mala.mp3" />
        </audio>

    <br />

    <video controls width="640" height="360">
            <source src="audio & videos/sistema de zonas.mp4" />
        </video>
    <!-- The controls attribute is important for controlling to play or pause the audio or video. 
        There are different atributes for this, they are able to see in this website:
         AUDIO: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp 
         VIDEO: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_video.asp 
         ASPECT RATIO 16:9: https://aspectratiocalculator.com/16-9.html -->
    <br />
    <!-- For inserting embebed code from youtube, just copy and paste that embed code and paste it anywhere-->
    <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uNulhfvsY2I" title="YouTube video
            player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write;
            encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <h2>Tables</h2>
    <!-- The tag it's called table, it has a closing tag.
        It must containg a tbody tag and inside that body we can define the columns and rows.
        It's best to do this with css rather html-->
    <table width="350" border="1">
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <!-- TR defines a Row (table row)-->
                <td>1</td>
                <!-- TD defines a Data Cell (table data cell)-->
                <td>2</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>4</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>IFRAMES</h2>

    <!--
       An iframe is a HTML document that is embedded within another HTML document on a Web site.
       That is, you can use iframe to insert certain content from another source into a Web page.
       This is how we emmbebed the youtube video before
    -->
    <iframe height="280" width="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kfM-yu0iQBk" frameborder="0" scrolling="auto" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media;
            gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
        </iframe>

    <h2>FORMS</h2>
    <!--
        It's possible to build web forms that actually submit data to a server.
        This forms rely on a "server side scripting".
        This means that it's neccesary to use something like php or asp to process the form.
        The form goes between the tags "form".
        There are text fields and text areas that are defined by inputs.
    -->
    <h3>INPUTS</h3>
    <!--
        Input elements are a convenient way to get input from your user.
        You can create a text input like this:
    -->
    <form>
        <input type="text" />
    </form>

    <!--
        Note that input elements are self-closing.
        Placeholder text is what is displayed in your input element before your user has 
        inputted anything.
        You can create placeholder text like so:
    -->
    <form>
        <input type="text" placeholder="this is placeholder text" />
    </form>
    <!--
        Text areas are for more extended information input. They work like this:
    -->
    <form>
        <br/>
        <textarea>
                Add your message here.
            </textarea>
        <br/>
    </form>

    <h4>Checkboxes</h4>

    <!--
        Checkboxes are a type of input
        Each of your checkboxes can be nested within its own label element. By wrapping an input element inside 
        of a label element it will automatically associate the checkbox input with the label element surrounding it
        All related checkbox inputs should have the same name attribute.
    -->
    <form>
        <label>
            <input type="checkbox" name="sameNameAttribute" value=coffee id="elementOne"/>coffee
        </label><br/>
        <label>
            <input type="checkbox" name="sameNameAttribute" value=tea id="elementTwo"/>tea
        </label><br/>
        <label>
            <input type="checkbox" name="sameNameAttribute" value=mate id="elementThree"/>mate
        </label><br/>
    </form>

    <h4>Radio Buttons</h4>

    <!--
        Radio Buttons are another type of input. They work in a similar way to checkboxes.
        The big difference is that by creating a radio group, selecting any single radio button
        will automatically deselect the other buttons within the same group ensuring only one answer
        is provided by the user.
    -->

    <form>
        <label> 
                <input type="radio" name="sameNameAttributeRadio" value="yes" id="element1"> yes
            </label><br/>
        <label> 
                <input type="radio" name="sameNameAttributeRadio" value="no" id="element2"> no
            </label><br/>
    </form>

    <h4>Submit button</h4>
    <!--
        Clicking this button will send the data from your form to the URL you specified with your form's 
        action attribute.
        You can require specific form fields so that your user will not be able to submit your form 
        until he or she has filled them out.
        For example, if you wanted to make a text input field required, you can just add the attribute required 
        within your input element, like this: <input type="text " required>
        When a form gets submitted, the data is sent to the server and includes entries for the options selected. 
        Inputs of type radio and checkbox report their values from the value attribute.
    -->

    <form>
        <button type="submit ">this button submits the form</button>
    </form>

    <!--
        To send the input to a specific web, you can do this by specifying an action attribute on your form element.
    -->
    <form action="https://url-where-you-want-to-submit-form-data ">
        <input type="text" placeholder="input data here">
        <button type="submit">SEND DATA</button>
    </form>

    <h2>FILE STRUCTURE & FILE NAME</h2>

    <!-- 
        -> ALWAYS name the home page as index.html / That's what the browser looks for to know wich file is the home 
        -> EVERY FILE should be in lowercase.
        -> DO NOT name the files with spaces, it's recommended to use a dash (-) (best practice) so the SEO can read it better.
        It interpretates the words separately and not as a single word. 
    -->
    <h2>METATAGS</h2>
    <!--
        A metatag tells the browser what the website is about.
        It goes at the begining of the web so the search engines generate results. (under the title tag)
        It uses the tag "meta" and includes a small description about the site in the "content" attribute.
    -->
    <meta name = "Description" content="Notes for Web Development Course">
    <!--
        Another type of metatag is "keywords", is not longer used but is better to have it for best practice.
        In this case it's not a description, but single words as keywords.
    -->
    <meta name = "Keywords" content="notes, course, web">
    <!--
        There's also another types of meta or attributes. Examples:
    
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="author" content="John Doe">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        There is more information at: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp
